#  Obstacle Course - a project for the C# 3D GameDev.Tv course

This repository contains the game I developed for the GameDev.Tv course C# 3D on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/). I used this course with the purpose of quickly getting into unity 6. The topics covered were as follows.

## Topics
1. Unity windows (Hierarchy, Project, Console, Inspector, Scene, Game, etc.)
2. Creating simple 3D objects within the scene.
3. Creating materials.
4. Using colors.
5. Adjusting smoothness.
6. Creating Scripts.
7. MonoBehaviour.
8. Start and Update methods.
9. Transform property and Translate method.
10. Arguments.
11. Floating point numbers.
12. Variables, constants and serialized fields.
13. Changing the play mode settings to quicker load the scene. Better for rapid prototyping. 
14. Code refactoring, conventions and scope.
15. Old and new input system.
16. Input manager.
17. Time.deltaTime to be independent from framerates. It calculates and evens out the movement for the frames of the computer based on the time passed.
18. Using thrid party packages.
19. Cinemachine.
20. Cinemachine position control, rotation control and damping
21. Grouping with parent objects.
22. Mesh Renderer.
23. Implementing physics with Box Collider and Rigidbody.
24. Using Triggers.
25. What methods are and how to use them.
26. Access modifiers, arguements, parameters, return, method body, method signature.
27. Using OnCollisionEnter.
28. Manipulating components with GetComponent. 
29. Increments and Decrements.
30. String interpolation.
31. Rotating directional light.
32. Locking and hiding elements in the editor.
33. Using Unity documentation.
34. Time.time to access the  time at the beginning of the current frame in seconds.
35. Using if statements as conditionals.
36. Caching references.
37. Learned about caching as storing frequently used data in memory.
38. Using Tags.
39. Accessing the tags from the same and from other objects.
40. Manipulating the rotation property.
41. Using vectors and the MoveTowards method to control object paths.
42. Referencing an object with a serialized field on another objectz.
43. Destroying objects.
44. Using triggers and trigger fields.
45. Used arrays and loops to optimize the generic code with multiple instances for the projectiles.
46. Definition and use of prefabs.
47. TBD
